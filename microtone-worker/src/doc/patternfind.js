// Find (item 177) — where in the project a predicate is TRUE.
//
// The predicate is patternquery.js's, unchanged: the same terms, the same
// operators, the same parsing, so "find every C-4 on instrument $03" and
// "change every C-4 on instrument $03" are one vocabulary asked two ways. What
// is new here is only the WALK — a query is a set, and a search is an ordered
// list you can step through — and the two orders a tracker actually thinks in:
//
//   SONG      play order: every cue in turn, every row of it, every channel
//             that has a pattern. This is the Timeline's own coordinate system,
//             so a hit is a place the cursor can simply go.
//   PATTERNS  the pattern bank: every materialised pattern, ascending, row by
//             row. A pattern no cue plays is still somewhere you can be
//             editing, and the song walk would never reach it.
//
// One pattern is usually placed in many cues (that is what cues are for), so
// the song walk evaluates each pattern's 64 rows ONCE and reuses the answer
// wherever the pattern is placed. Without that, a long song re-evaluates the
// same eight cells a hundred times over.
//
// The `row` a term can test is the row WITHIN the pattern, exactly as it is in
// Find & Change — "every fourth row" means the same thing in both, and the
// song's absolute row is a position on screen rather than something the music
// knows about.
//
// Pure: no DOM, no i18n. The bar over it is ui/findbar.js.
