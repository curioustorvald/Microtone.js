// Sample-pool regions (item 175) — the `SRgn` Project-Data section, §9.11.
//
// THE PREMISE: a Taud instrument's `sampleLength` is a U16, so no instrument
// and no Ixmp patch can ever claim more than 65535 bytes. The census
// (Document.sampleList) is derived from those claims and therefore cannot
// describe a recording longer than 64 KB at all — yet the pool is 8 MB, and
// the working method item 175 asks for is exactly "load a handful of very long
// recordings into memory, then cut every instrument out of them".
//
// A region is that recording: a named, rate-carrying span of the pool that
// exists WITHOUT an instrument claiming it. It changes no playback — a player
// that skips the section hears the same song (§9.8) — and does three things
// for the editor:
//
//   * it RESERVES its bytes, so the first-fit allocator and Housekeeping's
//     pool sweep both leave them alone (the bytes are, by construction,
//     claimed by nothing);
//   * it NAMES them, so the map view has something to draw and label;
//   * it carries the source rate, so an instrument cut out of it is in tune
//     without the user re-typing the number every time.
//
// Pure and DOM-free: the document model, the ops and the tests all read it.

 * The point of the map view and the cut-a-window tool is not the section — it
 * is that the pool is a long stretch of audio you can look at and take from.
 * That is true of a project full of converted module samples packed end to end
 * just as much as it is of a deliberately loaded recording, so the view offers
 * this whether or not the document declares a single region. It is a VIEW
 * only: it is never written to the file, it reserves nothing, and nothing
 * allocates or frees against it — `synthetic` marks it so no caller can pass
 * it to a plan by accident.
 *
 * The extent is 0 … the last occupied byte. Claims that fall outside the pool
 * (the junk instrument records every module conversion leaves behind, pointing
 * hundreds of megabytes past the end) are skipped, or the "whole memory" would
 * be mostly imaginary. Returns null for a pool with nothing in it.
 *

 * one between them, and a window cut out of this takes the rate of whatever
 * sample it lands in instead.
