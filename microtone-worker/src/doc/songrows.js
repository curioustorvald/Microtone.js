// Row-level song surgery (item 136.2): insert or delete ABSOLUTE song rows —
// the Timeline trough's Excel-style row commands. Pure planners; the invertible
// wrapper is remapPatternsOp (ops.js), which swaps in the whole patterns array +
// cue list + pNam in one undo step.
//
// A row here is a row of the SONG, so deleting one pulls the whole song below it
// UP THROUGH THE CUE GRID: the cue boundaries stay where they are and the music
// slides past them. Cue 4's first rows move into cue 3's tail, cue 5's into
// cue 4's, all the way down, and the song loses its last rows. That is what
// makes this expensive — every pattern from the cut to the end of the song ends
// up holding a different stretch of music, and each one has to be rebuilt.
//
// The rebuild is an OUTLINE, one entry per output cue:
//   { inherit, limit, rows }
//   rows === null → the cue plays exactly what `inherit` played (or nothing at
//                   all, when inherit is null): its cue word is copied and NO
//                   pattern is touched. Every cue above the cut is one of these.
//   rows !== null → the cue's content is rebuilt from those ABSOLUTE rows of the
//                   original song (-1 = a blank row an insert made).
//
// Patterns are then allocated per (output cue, channel) by the SEQUENCE of
// (pattern, row) pairs that slot resolves to. Slots resolving to the same
// sequence were drawing from the same source at the same alignment, so they were
// already sharing before the edit and go on sharing one pattern after it.
// Numbers are RECYCLED: a pattern only the rebuilt cues referenced is dead the
// moment they are rebuilt, so it is written over rather than left behind, and a
// shift costs roughly as many patterns as it frees instead of one per slot.
//
// Two alignments avoid the shift altogether, because they are exactly equivalent
// to plain cue-list surgery — deleting a whole number of cues is splicing them
// out, and inserting rows AT a cue boundary is inserting a blank cue. Those
// leave every pattern and all of their sharing untouched, which is also what the
// menu's "Patterns above/below" does on purpose.
//
// Cue instruction words follow: the row limit tracks the cue's new length,
// absolute jumps (JMP) are remapped through the old→new cue map and the relative
// pair (BAK/FWD) re-measured against it, so flow still points at the same music
// after cues have been added or removed.
