// Envelope node-array surgery (item 181) — pure functions over the decoded
// 25-node array and its two control words, shared by the base instrument's
// envelope tabs (ui/views/instruments.js) and the Ixmp patch editor's
// envelope sub-tabs (ui/views/instadvanced.js). Both had their own copy; the
// copies disagreed about nothing, which is how they both carried the same two
// bugs for as long as they existed.
//
// THE ARRAY IS ALWAYS 25 NODES LONG AND THE COUNT IS IMPLIED. A node's
// `offset` is the duration of the segment that FOLLOWS it, so a zero offset
// marks the end: the active count is "index of the first zero-offset node,
// plus one" (TAUD_FILE_FORMAT.md §7.2). Nothing stores a length, which is why
// every edit here is really an edit to where that terminator sits — and why
// "delete the last node" is not "shift the array down one".

 * are both 0, which IS the last node of a one-node envelope).

 * the envelope's PRESENCE — the moment an envelope goes from "the file says
 * this instrument has none" to "here is one". That envelope is being built
 * now, so the sustain is switched on with it and its points move like a live
 * one's: the first appended node arrives with the sustain already holding the
 * tail, instead of the box needing to be found before any of it does anything.
