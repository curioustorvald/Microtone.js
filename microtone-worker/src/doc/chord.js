// ── Extraclassical harmony: arto and tendo (item 167) ────────────────────────
// Ultramajor ("tendo", T) and inframinor ("arto", r) triads are the ordinary
// major and minor shapes with the third pushed a further quarter tone OUT: an
// arto third of ~235-255 ¢ under the fifth, a tendo third of ~445-465 ¢ over
// the root. They behave like major and minor — tendo is the consonant one —
// but they are CROSS-TONAL: unlike a major and a minor third, which clash, an
// arto and a tendo third sit a whole tone apart and can sound together over
// one root (the 20:23:26:30 chord). Source: Xenharmonic Wiki "Arto and tendo /
// Extraclassical tonality", kept at
// tsvm/reference_materials/xenharmonics/Extraclassical tonality.mediawiki.
//
// The wiki gives TWO definitions, and they do not always pick the same pair:
//
//   LATITUDE — a third's position between root and fifth, measured as
//   (third/fifth − 1/2) × 180°, so 0° is dead centre (a neutral third) and
//   ±90° is the fifth itself. Major/minor sit around ±13°; arto/tendo are
//   ±24-28° canonically, ±22.5-30° by the wiki's own broadened table. This is
//   what makes the chord SOUND extraclassical, and it needs no notation at
//   all. Reproducing it over every EDO reproduces the wiki's tuning table
//   exactly (5, 10, 15, 16, 19, 24, 29, 31, 41, 53 … — and correctly finds
//   nothing in 17 or 22).
//
//   QUALITY ARITHMETIC — arto = semi-diminished, tendo = semi-augmented, i.e.
//   half a chroma under the minor/perfect interval and half a chroma over the
//   major/perfect one. It needs a diatonic EDO whose chroma is an EVEN number
//   of steps, and then it spells a whole LADDER (tendo unison … arto octave),
//   which is where the extended vocabulary below comes from. Only the halves
//   of the scale it can reach are extraclassical by ear, though: 17-TET's
//   quality thirds are at ±36° (its tendo third IS its perfect fourth, the
//   very collision the wiki warns about) and 31-TET's are at ±20°.
//
//   And one tuning gets in on neither, by the wiki's §Use cases: "in diatonic
//   edos sharper than, and even in, 22edo, the native diatonic major and minor
//   triads begin to border on arto and tendo". A superpyth fifth drags the
//   ORDINARY thirds outwards until they arrive of their own accord — 22-TET's
//   are 273 ¢ and 436 ¢, within 6 ¢ of 7/6 and 9/7, which is the first 7-limit
//   tuning the wiki lists for the pair (a closer fit than 31-TET's spelt one),
//   even though their latitude is only ±20.8° and the chroma is odd. The
//   cross-tonality then lives in the chromatic 5L7s MOS, which carries both
//   thirds over one root. Among our notations that criterion — a proper 5L2s
//   diatonic with a fifth at least as sharp as 22-TET's 709 ¢ — picks out
//   22-TET and nothing else.
//
// Where a tuning offers both readings we offer both, tagged with the just
// ratios each is closest to. 41-TET is the wiki's own headline case ("first
// tuning with 2 pairs"); 31-TET's two are its 7/6-9/7 spelling and its
// slendric 8/7-21/16 one; 96-TET, which the wiki's table stops short of, has
// three by the same arithmetic.
//
// EVERYTHING ELSE IS DERIVED, not tabulated — the pair plus the fifth is
// enough, because the ladder is closed under stacking and octave inversion:
//     arto/tendo seventh = fifth + arto/tendo third
//     tendo second = octave − arto seventh   arto second = octave − tendo 7th
//     tendo sixth  = octave − arto third     arto sixth  = octave − tendo 3rd
// Checked against every cell of the wiki's 17/24/31/41 table (see
// test/node/chord.test.js), which it reproduces but for three typos there:
// 31-TET's tendo fourth is 542 ¢ not 541, its arto fifth 658 ¢ not 659, and
// 41-TET's arto fifth 644 ¢ not 654 (654 ¢ is not even a degree of 41-TET).
// The altered fourths and fifths are the exception: they are half a chroma off
// a perfect interval, so only the quality tunings have them, and only those
// get the arto-diminished and tendo-augmented triads.
//
// NOT offered, and why: 12-TET (and the 12-note historical notations) is too
// coarse to place a third a quarter tone outside major, and its own thirds
// sit at ±12.9°, nowhere near far enough out to arrive there by themselves;
// 5- and 10-TET have a pair but too few degrees to voice it — every
// extraclassical chord there is just a slice of the pentatonic scale. Nor do
// we sweep for ANY well-tuned 7/6-9/7 or 8/7-21/16 pair a fine tuning happens
// to contain (53-TET has three such, 96-TET four): the wiki never does that,
// and three near-identical vocabularies 23 ¢ apart is a menu, not a choice.

// Its canonical tunings are sqrt(3/2) = 351 ¢ (literally half a just fifth),
// 11/9 = 347 ¢ and 16/13 = 359 ¢, and the wiki's band is ~341-361 ¢. Source:
// Xenharmonic Wiki "Neutral (interval quality)", kept at
// tsvm/reference_materials/xenharmonics/"Neutral (interval quality).mediawiki".
//
// Neutral is NOT extraclassical and gets its own menu group: arto and tendo
// sit OUTSIDE major and minor, neutral sits BETWEEN them. (The wiki keeps them
// apart too — its "tendoneutral" is a neutral quality, not the "tendo" above.)
//
// The same stack-and-invert algebra generates the rest of the ladder, with the
// pair collapsed to a single interval, and it lands on the wiki's own
// canonical values every time:
//     neutral seventh = fifth + neutral third   (24-TET: 1050 ¢ ≈ 11/6)

// tuning has to be able to SPELL that half. An even fifth (in steps) splits
// exactly; an odd one cannot, and the two degrees either side of the centre
// are precisely the wiki's ARTONEUTRAL (flat of centre, 11/9 territory) and
