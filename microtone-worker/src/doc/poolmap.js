// Pool memory map (item 166) — the sample pool as ADDRESSES, not as a list.
//
// sampleList() is a census: it dedupes by (ptr:len) and hands back one tidy
// object per distinct claim. That is the right abstraction for naming, editing
// and exporting, and it is a lie about memory. Two instruments can claim
// overlapping byte ranges of one recording with different lengths and loops and
// get two rows; a deleted sample leaves a hole the list cannot mention; a junk
// instrument record (every S3M/IT conversion has a few, up at slots $1FD–$1FF)
// claims a pointer nowhere near the 8 MB pool and still gets a row that looks
// exactly like a real sample. This module resolves the census back onto the
// address line so all of that becomes visible.
//
// Pure and DOM-free — the Samples view's memory panel draws it, tests read it.
