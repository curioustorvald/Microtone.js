// Automatic loop-region resolver (item 176) — given a pooled sample's bytes and
// the loop MODE the instrument is set to, find the region that plays with the
// least audible seam, as long as the material allows one. Pure: it returns
// NUMBERS (loop start/end plus the quality it measured) and never touches
// audio, so the caller writes them through setInstBytesOp like any other marker
// edit and the whole search is one undo step. Node-tested; no DOM, no engine.
//
// WHAT THE CLICK IS, per mode — read off the engine's own loop arithmetic in
// src/engine/sampler.js `advanceSamplePos`, not from tracker folklore:
//
//   FORWARD (mode 1) wraps with `samplePos -= loopLen`, so the wrap maps e → s
//   exactly: the ear has just heard x[e-1] and expects x[e], x[e+1]…, and gets
//   x[s], x[s+1]… The click is the mismatch between the two forward windows —
//   a PAIR cost over (start, length), and the reason this half of the problem
//   needs a search at all. Restricting lengths to whole pitch periods is what
//   makes that search finish in milliseconds instead of minutes.
//
//   PING-PONG (mode 2) clamps to loopEnd and flips, and clamps to loopStart and
//   flips: both ends are a true REFLECTION. The value is therefore continuous
//   by construction and the discontinuity is in the first derivative — a corner
//   — whose size depends on ONE endpoint alone. So ping-pong's two ends are
//   independent, the whole scan is O(n), and "maximise the region" collapses to
//   "the earliest and the latest point inside the click budget". It also means
//   the right place for a ping-pong end is a PEAK or a TROUGH (where the wave
//   is locally even about the point), never the zero crossing a forward loop
//   wants — the two modes pull in opposite directions, which is precisely why
//   the mode has to be an input to the search.
//
// The cost is always a residual RATIO — seam RMS over the local signal RMS —
// not an absolute one. A click is heard against the sound carrying it, and the
// same 4-LSB step is inaudible under a loud sustain and obvious under a decayed
// tail. -20 dB (0.1) is roughly where it stops being a tick and becomes texture.
//
// WHAT IT CANNOT DO: on material that evolves (any real single note — decay,
// vibrato, a filter opening) a LONG loop has no click-free seam at all, whatever
// search runs. Length and cleanliness genuinely trade against each other, so
// the resolver reports the whole trade-off (`front`, `widest`) and the caller
// picks a policy on it. Buying a long loop that the material will not give
// needs the audio CROSSFADED, which is the Sample Lab's job — this module only
// ever moves markers.
