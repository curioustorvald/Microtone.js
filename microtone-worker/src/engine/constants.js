// ── Output sampling rate (web item 108) ───────────────────────────────────
// DELIBERATE web divergence from Kotlin's fixed 32000. Browsers run their
// AudioContext at 48 kHz, so a 32 kHz engine had to be resampled on the way
// out — for playback AND for the default 48 kHz WAV export. Rendering at
// 48 kHz deletes that stage from both default paths: at a 48 kHz context the
// worklet's read cursor steps by exactly 1.0 and one TRACKER_CHUNK is exactly
// one render quantum.
//
// Everything rate-derived (tick length, the IT/SF2 filter coefficients, the
// Amiga LPF/LED coefficients, the anti-click ramps) is computed FROM this
// value, so the audible parameters stay where they are in Hz and in
// milliseconds — what changes is that they are now realised on a 48 kHz grid.
//
// It is a `let`, not a const: setSamplingRate() below puts the engine back on
// 32 kHz for the JVM-oracle conformance tests and the Kotlin-mirroring
// scenario tests, which compare against 32 kHz reference renders. Set it ONCE
// before rendering — like rng.js's seed, it is start-up configuration, not a
// per-render parameter.

// deterministic corpus. DELIBERATE web divergence from Kotlin's 512: the
// AudioWorklet must finish each render inside one ~2.67 ms quantum, and a 512-
