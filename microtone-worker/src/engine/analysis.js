// Master-bus analysis tap (item 98) — what the mastering strip looks at.
//
// The strip asks two different questions, and they want two different signals:
//
//   * "where is the energy in the room?" — the vectorscopes. That is a question
//     about the SOUND FIELD, not about any particular set of speakers, so the
//     scope tap is always first-order B-format (ACN/SN3D: W Y Z X). The three
//     Lissajous views are then literally axis pairs of that field — top = Y·X
//     (left-right against front-back), front = Y·Z, side = X·Z — and no view
//     needs a decode. A STEREO song has no front-back axis at all, so its tap
//     is taken from the finished mix instead: W = (L+R)/√2, Y = (L−R)/√2, which
//     is exactly the stereo→B-format encoding of a ±90° pair, and makes the top
//     view the classic mid/side goniometer. One display, every model.
//
//   * "will it clip, and how loud is it?" — the meters. That IS a question
//     about a target: 5.1's centre channel is only a thing if you are mastering
//     for 5.1. So the meters read a metering TARGET the user picks, rendered
//     through the very same renderers the exporter uses (speakers.js), which is
//     what makes the bars agree with the file that comes out.
//
// ── The ambisonic case ──
// There are no speakers to meter, so per-speaker levels are meaningless. What
// IS meaningful is the acoustic energy density of the encoded field,
//
//     E = (W² + X² + Y² + Z²) / 2
//
// which for SN3D order 1 reads p² for a plane wave from ANY direction and sums
// correctly over uncorrelated sources — a direction-invariant loudness that
// needs no decode and no listening position. Peak is per encoded CHANNEL (that
// is what clips in the exported file), oversampled 4× for the inter-sample
// peaks a later decode or resample would expose.
//
// Not a port: the Kotlin engine has no surround and no analysis tap, so this
// file — like spatial.js and binaural.js — IS the reference implementation.
//
// COST: everything here is opt-in. The tap is built only while the strip is on
// screen, and a stereo song never pays for a bus at all (its tap is two adds on
// the finished mix). See TrackerState.setAnalysis.
