// Sample-modification note effects (items 130, 152, 153) — notefx 2 and 3, ONE
// command with two spellings: `3` names the region to modify, `2` names the
// region to leave alone. Both are NON-DESTRUCTIVE views over the sample pool,
// exactly as S $Fxxx is: the state lives on the INSTRUMENT and is applied when
// a byte is read (sampler.js readSamplePoint), so the pool itself is never
// written.
//
// Behavioural contract: TAUD_NOTE_EFFECTS.md §"2 $sexy and 3 $sexy".
//
//   $s $e   the region (see decodeSampleRegion)
//   $x      the operation — one at a time, so an instrument carries ONE
//           modification and writing either opcode replaces it
//   $y      the step period in TICKS: $F every tick, $E every other one, down
//           to $1 every fifteenth; $0 freezes (see modStepPeriod)
//
// EVERYTHING IS RELATIVE TO THE LOOP REGION (item 153). The command's domain is
// the sounding voice's loop when it has one and the whole sample when it does
// not, and every selector, every comb, every wrap and every jump quantum is
// measured against THAT — never against raw byte counts and never against the
// base record, so an Ixmp-patched voice follows its own loop (item 116) and a
// region written for one sample means the same thing on the next. The extent is
// therefore stored as a FRACTION pair and resolved per voice at read time
// (resolveModGeom), which is also what lets $A's eighths land on the eighths of
// a bar-length loop rather than of the file that contains it.
//
// Region argument, decoded once here so the two spellings cannot drift apart:
//
//   $00        the whole domain — the loop region, as S $Fxxx has always meant
//              it (same span as $0F, which is the spelling to reach for when
//              the point is "all of it" rather than "the loop")
//   $s..$e     s <= e: from s/16 to (e+1)/16 of the domain, rounded
//              — so $0F is all of it and $4B the middle half
//   $10        middle half            $20 first two thirds   $21 last two thirds
//   $30 $31 $32  first / middle / last third
//   $F0..$FE   COMB, even bristles: cut the extent into 2^(n+1) equal chunks
//              and keep the 0th, 2nd, 4th… — $F0 is the first HALF, $F1 is
//              '1-3-' of four, $FE is 32768 bristles
//   $E0..$ED   COMB, odd bristles: the same cut keeping the 1st, 3rd, 5th…
//              — $E0 is the second half, $E1 is '-2-4' of four
