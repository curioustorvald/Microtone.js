// FM operator racks — Metainstrument type 4 (item 159). No Kotlin counterpart
// yet: this is a Microtone-first format extension, specified in
// TAUD_FILE_FORMAT.md §7.6 and TAUD_ENGINE_SPEC.md §5.5.1.
//
// A layered metainstrument (type 0) is `n` instruments sounding side by side.
// A type-4 rack is the opposite arrangement: the same 10-byte table, but its
// entries are OPERATORS that feed each other, and the whole rack is ONE voice.
// The wiring is an RPN program packed into the record's tail, so an algorithm
// is data — there is no fixed set of "algorithm 1…32" to choose from.
//
// The oscillator of a classic FM chip is a sine table. Here it is an ordinary
// Taud instrument: its sample IS the waveform, its loop IS the cycle, and its
// envelope, filter, auto-vibrato and detune all keep working. Modulate a
// single-cycle loop and the result is textbook phase modulation; modulate a
// drum hit and it is something no DX7 could do.

/**
 * The live rack behind one sounding note. Allocated per trigger, hung off the
 * channel's foreground Voice as `voice.fmRig`, and dropped the moment that
 * voice is retriggered with anything else.
 *
 * `voices[0]` is the channel's OWN voice — operator 0 sounds on it, which is
 * what gives the note a lifetime, an envelope and a place in the mix. Operators
 * 1… are background voices flagged `fmOperator`, so the tick pass maintains
 * them like layer children while the mixer leaves them alone: they are read
 * from here, not summed.
 *
 * A null slot is an operator that is not sounding this note — gated out by its
 * rectangle, pointed at nothing, or simply never named by the algorithm — and
 * reads as a constant 0.
