//
//   * driven by each voice's CONTROL volume (audio.getVoiceEffectiveVolume —
//     the same number the Timeline channel header's own VU bar already
//     shows), never a measured/audible level;
//   * several simultaneous voices lighting the same row (one instrument
//     played as a chord, or several instruments sharing one sample) combine
//     as a probabilistic OR, not a sum that could blow past full brightness;
//   * a fast attack and a slow decay, so it snaps on with the note but fades
//     like an afterglow rather than switching off — the same ballistics
//     shape a VU meter's needle uses, just asymmetric the other way (a meter
//     falls fast and holds its peak; a lamp lights fast and lingers).
