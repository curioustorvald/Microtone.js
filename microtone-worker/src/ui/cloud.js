// Soundfield cloud (item 133) — the master strip's fourth scope family, and the
// only one that draws the spatial IMAGE rather than the field itself.
//
// The radiation monitor (radiation.js) answers "what does the field radiate in
// each direction?" exactly, and bluntly: it is one smooth surface, so two
// sources thirty degrees apart are one broad lobe. This one asks the sharper
// question — "where is the energy actually coming FROM, frequency by
// frequency?" — and answers it as a cloud of splats, one per frequency tile.
// Different sources occupy different tiles, so they separate.
//
// ── The parameters, per bin ──
// The ring is SECOND-ORDER B-format. Order 1 gives a complex pressure W and a
// complex velocity v = (X, Y, Z); from them, three real quantities:
//
//     P  = |W|²                     the pressure power
//     Ia = Re{ conj(W)·v }          the ACTIVE intensity — net transport
//     Vt = |v|²                     the velocity power
//
// (Ia points AT the source in our SN3D convention — see encodeSN3D.)
//
// ── The radius is |Ia| / P, and that IS the transfer function ──
// For two coherent sources at ±θ the arithmetic gives, with no fitting and no
// curve, exactly
//
//     |Ia| / P = cos θ
//
// so a single source (θ = 0) is at the rim, an ordinary ±30° stereo pair sits
// at cos 30° = 0.87, ±60° at 0.5, and ±90° — equidistant either side of you —
// at 0. That last is the in-head phantom you actually hear from such a pair.
//
// ── …but only for the part of the field that PROPAGATES ──
// Invert one source of a pair and W cancels to nothing: there is no net
// transport at all, Ia = 0, and a radius alone would send it to the centre —
// to exactly where the in-phase pair goes. That is wrong twice over, because an
// anti-phase pair does not image in the middle; it is heard as two separate
// sources, wide apart.
//
// So the bin is SPLIT, by how much of the velocity the pressure can explain:
//
//     Vres = max(0, Vt − P)         velocity the pressure cannot account for
//
// — because a propagating wave carries exactly as much velocity power as
// pressure power, so any EXCESS is air being moved by sources that are
// cancelling each other in pressure. The propagating part becomes ONE splat at Î_a
// with the radius above; the residue becomes a PAIR of splats on the rim, at
// both ends of the axis the residual velocity oscillates along. A single source
// and an in-phase pair have no residue at all, an anti-phase pair is nothing
// but residue, and real material is a mixture — which is the point.
//
// ── …and order 2 says WHERE the two of them are ──
// At first order that residue is only an AXIS. Worse, it is the same axis
// whatever the separation: two anti-phase sources at ±15° and at ±90° encode to
// identical W Y Z X, so a first-order display has to draw both of them a full
// 180° apart and overstate the width of every one.
//
// Order 2 breaks it. For an anti-phase pair the order-2 field is a pure
// quadrupole,
//
//     T = a·sin2θ·(ĉ ûᵀ + û ĉᵀ)
//
// with û the dipole axis order 1 already gave and ĉ the bearing the pair
// straddles. Since ĉ ⊥ û, one matrix-vector product recovers both:
//
//     T û = a·sin2θ·ĉ        ⇒   ĉ = normalise(T û),  cos θ = |T û| / |v|
//
// and the two sources are ĉ·cos θ ± û·sin θ. Exact, in three dimensions, at any
// bearing and any elevation — so an anti-phase pair is drawn where it actually
// is rather than flung to the edges.
//
// ── What the splats carry ──
//   position  the intensity direction, at the radius above (or the rim, for
//             the anti-phase pair)
//   colour    the tile's band (RAD_BANDS), same inks as the radiation surface
//   SIZE      the tile's level in DECIBELS, after the same +4.5 dB/oct tilt
//   ALPHA     how much of that direction is still being HELD — see below
//
// ── Size and opacity are both the level ──
// A splat's size and its opacity are the same reading — its level in decibels,
// after the same tilt the radiation surface uses. Loud is big and solid, quiet
// is small and faint, and the two never disagree with one another. (An earlier
// pass drove opacity from whether the note's key was still down; it made a song
// with no key-offs at all read as a flat wall, and one reading per channel is
// worth more than two that compete.)
//
// Nothing here touches the DOM: the analyser owns typed arrays and the renderer
// fills a caller's RGBA bytes, exactly as crtbeam.js and radiation.js do.
