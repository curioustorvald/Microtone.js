// Ambisonic spectral radiation monitor (item 129) — the master strip's third
// scope family, and the only one that draws the field as a SOLID.
//
// The blobs family draws where the SOURCES are; the goniometer family draws the
// SOUND as a pair of axes. Neither can answer the question this one exists for:
// what does the field the song actually radiates LOOK like, and what is it made
// of? So this one builds a single three-dimensional surface —
//
//     r(θ, φ) = |p(θ, φ)|,   p(θ, φ) = W + Y·dy + Z·dz + X·dx
//
// — the coherent first-order beam steered in every direction at once, and looks
// at it through the same three orthographic cameras the other two families use.
// One soundfield, one surface, three observations: the front, side and top
// panels are the SAME object seen from three places, not three measurements.
//
// ── Why the sum happens before the magnitude ──
// p is LINEAR in the four B-format channels, so two sources that are coherent
// add as amplitudes and only then get squared. That is the whole point, and it
// is what a per-channel level meter can never show you:
//
//   * two equal in-phase sources 60° apart do not draw two lobes. They draw one
//     lobe between them, because that is what the field does — the phantom
//     centre is not a rendering rule, it is arithmetic.
//   * invert one of them and the same two sources draw two lobes with a null
//     between them, because p₁ + p₂ became p₁ − p₂ before the square.
//
// There is no special case in here for either. Phase is not a separate readout
// bolted to the side of the display; it is the shape.
//
// ── What is a band, and what is a colour ──
// The field is analysed in five bands (RAD_BANDS), over a spectrum TILTED by
// +4.5 dB/octave first (RAD_TILT_DB_PER_OCT) so that natural material reads
// balanced rather than as bass with a garnish. The SUM of the bands decides the
// geometry and their RATIO decides the colour, so a direction reads its spectrum
// as a hue and its energy as a distance — a quiet cymbal and a loud one are the
// same colour and different sizes, which is the only way a colour scale can mean
// anything at all.
//
// Each band's whole state is one 4×4 real symmetric cross-spectral matrix,
//
//     G_b[i][j] = Σ_{f ∈ b} Re{ S_i(f) · conj(S_j(f)) }
//
// and the directional energy falls straight out of it as a quadratic form,
// E_b(d) = cᵀ G_b c with c = [1, dy, dz, dx]. Ten numbers per band hold every
// interference relationship in it, which is why a thousand directions cost ten
// multiply-adds each instead of a thousand beamformers.
//
// ── Cost ──
// Nothing in here runs unless a radiation panel is on screen. The analysis is
// done ONCE per strip however many panels are up (they are views of one object),
// and it is paced by a hop in AUDIO time rather than by the frame rate, so a
// 144 Hz display does not pay three times over for the same window.
//
// Nothing here touches the DOM: the analyser owns typed arrays and the renderer
// fills a caller's RGBA bytes, exactly as crtbeam.js does, which is what lets
// test/node/radiation.test.js drive the real thing.
