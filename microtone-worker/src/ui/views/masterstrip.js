// Master channel strip (item 98) — the mastering view, docked to the right of
// the Timeline grid: a stack of scope panels over one fader + meter.
//
// Everything it draws comes from the engine's analysis tap (src/engine/
// analysis.js) through the snapshot, and the two kinds of panel ask different
// questions of it:
//
//   * the SCOPES read the first-order B-format ring, so they show the sound
//     FIELD and never a particular speaker set. Their axes are literally the
//     field's own: left-right is Y, front-back is X, up-down is Z. A stereo
//     song has no front-back axis at all, so its vertical is the mono sum W —
//     which is exactly the classic mid/side goniometer, drawn by the same code.
//   * the METERS read a metering TARGET you pick, rendered through the same
//     renderers the exporter uses. What the bars say is what the file will hold.
//
// The fader is the SONG's global volume, not a monitor gain: effects V and W
// move it while the song plays and the cap follows them, but letting go of the
// mouse writes the project's value (one undo step per drag), and stopping
// playback snaps the cap back to it.
//
// ── Layout: one state, one reconciler ──
// A scope panel is a FIXED size — chooser, square dial, correlation bar — set
// by the strip's width, so how many of them fit is a question about the
// viewport's height, and the meter takes whatever they leave.
//
// `layout()` is the ONLY place that decides any of it. Adding a panel, closing
// one, dragging the divider, resizing the window and loading a song all end
// there, and when it returns `this.scopes` is the panels, `this.drawn` is how
// many are up, and the meter's height follows from that. Nothing keeps a
// second opinion, because two opinions is how this went wrong: a `fit` computed
// in one place and a panel list edited in another disagreed the moment either
// changed, so the strip believed in three panels while showing six, "+" refused
// to add a fourth, and a resize "fixed" it by accident.
//
// The COUNT is that state, and everything is expressed as setting it: "+" is
// one more, the chooser's "hide this panel" is one fewer, and the divider — a
// fixed panel size means where it sits and how many panels are above it are the
// same fact — drags straight to a count, closing panels on the way down and
// opening them on the way up. (The ✕ in the header hides the whole strip.)
