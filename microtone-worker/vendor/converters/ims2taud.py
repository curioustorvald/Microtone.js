"""ims2taud.py — Iyagi Music Sound (.IMS) to TSVM Taud (.taud)

Usage:
    python3 ims2taud.py input.ims output.taud [-b song.BNK] [-b STANDARD.BNK] [-v]

IMS is the music format of "Iyagi", the Korean BBS terminal of the early 1990s:
an AdLib ROL score converted to a MIDI-shaped event stream at 240 ticks per beat,
with the instrument patches named — not stored — so a companion `.BNK` bank has
to supply them.  Its titles are 2-byte Johab Korean.

What this converter does:

    - recovers the composer's ROW GRID from the delta times.  ROL was a
      step sequencer, so the greatest common divisor of every delta IS the
      original tick, and `240 ÷ gcd` the rows per beat.  Every observed GCD
      divides 240, so no event is ever quantised away.
    - compiles each patch the song names into a Taud FM operator rack
      (opl2taud), fitted to the notes that song actually plays it at
    - writes eleven channels, one per OPL voice — channel IS voice in this
      format, so there is no allocation to do — with notes, pitch bends,
      volumes and tempo changes on the grid
    - declares the song's tuning as the chip's own middle C, so a converted
      note sounds at the frequency the AdLib card would have given it

Bends are the hard part and the biggest source of loss: IMS uses 2.6 million of
them across the reference corpus — they are not an ornament, they are how the
format writes portamento and vibrato — and they are followed here at ROW
resolution with fine pitch slides, which is exact at every row boundary and
loses the shape in between.

See TAUD_CONVERSION_NOTES.md for what else does not survive.
